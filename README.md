# SimpleWebScrapper

# MSc Project in Web scraper using C#
This repository contains the codebase for my MSc project, a Simple Web Scraper implemented in C#. 

This project explores fundamental web scraping techniques using regular expressions and the builder pattern, focusing on efficient data extraction from structured websites.

# Project Objectives

1. To implement flexible scraping criteria using regular expressions for pattern matching.
2. To utilize the builder pattern for constructing clear and maintainable scraping configurations.
3. To incorporate exception handling mechanisms for robust error management during web requests.
4. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the scraper through unit tests and real-world examples.


# Methodology

Data Extraction: The scraper leverages regular expressions to define patterns for identifying and extracting desired data elements from the target website's HTML structure.
Scrape Criteria: The builder pattern is employed to create a flexible and readable way to define the scraping criteria, including the target URL, regular expressions for data extraction, and any additional parameters.
Exception Handling: The scraper incorporates exception handling mechanisms to gracefully manage potential errors during web requests, ensuring the application's robustness.

# Conclusion

This MSc project successfully developed a functional and adaptable web scraper, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining regular expressions and the builder pattern for targeted data extraction.
